Project Description:

• What is the purpose of the software? The purpose of this software is to help people achieve their goal of losing weight. I will have a beginner and intermediate workout routine. Users will have the availability to perform these workouts from home or in the gym. This software is going to be completely free for users.

• Where and when will the software be used? This software can be used at home or at the gym. This workout routine doesn't require any equipment so it will be easier for the users to do them.

• How does the software work? The users will insert their weight and height, then it will ask them if you want a beginner workout or an intermediate workout. Then, if you chose beginner it will give you 5 workouts. If you are an intermediate the software will give you 5 different workouts.

• Why would anyone want to use the software over existing processes? I think people would like to use this software because you will have it for free, no equipment is required, and you can do the workouts from home or at the gym.
